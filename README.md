'''
British code names, after the war, typically were generated by taking a random color and a random noun -- blue peacock, red steel, green flash, that sort of thing.

I've written a file of colors and a file of nouns.  I want you to write a codename generator that reads these files, parses them appropriately, and outputs a random color, followed by a random noun.

Files:
  /tmp/colors.txt
  /tmp/nouns.txt
